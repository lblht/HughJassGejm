    m_Localized: "Platelets, also known as thrombocytes, are tiny cell fragments
      in the blood that play an important role in blood clotting. When there is an
      injury, platelets rush to the site of the injury and stick together to form
      a plug that helps stop bleeding. \n\nPlatelets are produced in the bone marrow
      and can live for about 7 to 10 days in the bloodstream. Low platelet levels
      can lead to a bleeding disorder called thrombocytopenia, while high platelet
      levels can increase the risk of blood clots."

    m_Localized: "Bacteria are tiny single-celled organisms that can be found almost
      everywhere. Some types of bacteria can cause infections in humans, such as
      Clostridium tetani which causes tetanus. \n\nWhen this type of bacteria gets
      into the body through a wound or cut, it cause an infection in the body, they
      can use the body's nutrients and other resources to grow and reproduce. This
      can lead to symptoms like fever, fatigue, and loss of appetite, as the body
      tries to fight off the infection and regain control of its resources."

    m_Localized: "Saccharides, also known as carbohydrates or sugars, are one of
      the main types of nutrients found in food. They are made up of simple sugar
      molecules that our bodies use as a source of energy. \n\nThere are different
      types of saccharides, including simple sugars like glucose and fructose, and
      complex carbohydrates like starches and fibers. \n\nEating a balanced diet
      with the right amount of saccharides can help keep our bodies healthy and provide
      us with the energy we need to go about our day."

    m_Localized: "Salt is a mineral that is made up of two components, sodium and
      chloride. Sodium is a chemical element that plays an important role in our
      body by regulating the balance of fluids and helping to transmit nerve impulses.
      \n\nHowever, consuming too much sodium can be harmful and increase the risk
      of high blood pressure and other health problems. It's important to maintain
      a balanced diet and limit our intake of salty foods."

    m_Localized: Lipids are a type of molecule that our bodies use for energy, insulation,
      and protection. They are also important for the structure of cell membranes.
      Lipids come in different forms such as fats, oils, and waxes. While some lipids
      are unhealthy in excess, others like omega-3 fatty acids are important for
      our overall health.

    m_Localized: "Vitamin C is a nutrient that our body needs to stay healthy. It
      helps us make collagen, a protein that keeps our skin, bones, and blood vessels
      strong. It also helps our immune system fight off infections, like colds. \n\nYou
      can get vitamin C from foods like oranges, strawberries, kiwi, and broccoli.
      It's important to eat a variety of these foods to make sure you get enough
      vitamin C every day."

    m_Localized: Macrophages are like the body's crime-fighters, patrolling for harmful
      invaders and gobbling them up. They help protect your body by eating germs,
      viruses, and other harmful particles, cleaning up dead cells, and working with
      other immune cells to keep you safe and healthy.

    m_Localized: Neutrophils are the fast-acting first responders in your immune
      system, racing to the scene of an infection to neutralize harmful bacteria
      and germs. They catch and destroy invaders in various ways, including releasing
      chemicals or swallowing them, and work together with other immune cells to
      keep you protected.

    m_Localized: Dendritic cells are the immune system's messengers or spies, capturing
      a small piece of harmful invaders and presenting it to other immune cells,
      like T-cells. By doing this, they help your body recognize and respond to threats,
      creating a targeted defense to keep you safe.

    m_Localized: T-cells are the elite special forces of your immune system, working
      together to protect your body from harmful invaders. They have different roles,
      such as creating antibiotics, directly attacking infected cells, and maintaining
      balance in the immune response, ensuring your body remains healthy and safe.
